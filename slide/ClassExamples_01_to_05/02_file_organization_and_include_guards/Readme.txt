The main file is not doing anything here. The idea of this example is merely to show the organization of a project into cpp files which contain the implementation, and header files which contain the class definitions. It also demonstrates the addition of include guards which are important to prevent double definitions. In this example here, Calendar includes both Birthday and Meeting, which both need Date. Without include guards, we would have a double definition of Date.
